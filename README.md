Coursera Capstone Project_Cyclisic
This is my first attempt at a Case Study while completing the Coursera Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
**Biggest Lessons**
1. Take notes as you go. For everything. Even if your thought process is messy, you'll learn to tidy your thought process if you document.
2. There is more than one way to skin a cat: try out multiple searches and test different techniques.
3. Try to restructure any searches for syntax help with the terms you learn along the way.
